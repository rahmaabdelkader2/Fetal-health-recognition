# Fetal-health-recognition
(This project considered my final project at Ai intern for Samsung Innovation Campus)

## Brief about project
Maternal mortality is unacceptably high. About 295 000 women died during and following pregnancy and childbirth in 2017. 
So what if I told you that we will be able to predict fetus health and prevent several deaths among mothers and their babies before and during labor?
As reduction of child mortality is reflected in several of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and is a key indicator of human progress.

## About dataset
Our dataset is concerned about the fetal heart rate and movement of the fetus. 
As they are the most important parameters for health indication in babies before labor.
Healthcare providers measure fetal heart rate by the number of fetal (baby) heartbeats per minute (BPM) during pregnancy.
This measurement helps healthcare providers determine the well-being of the fetus during prenatal visits or labor.
